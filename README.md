# Fake News Prediction with Chatbot Integration
A scalable Fake News Detection system built using Flask and Machine Learning, integrated with a chatbot interface to simulate real-time user interactions. The project explores personalization and trust scoring mechanisms to improve prediction accuracy and user validation.

Project Overview

The Fake News Prediction system leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to detect and classify news as real or fake. Users can input text via a web interface or interact with a chatbot for seamless communication. This project explores trust scoring, user personalization, and model confidence to provide a production-style solution that’s user-friendly and efficient.

Features
- Flask-based web application for fast and lightweight deployment.
- Chatbot integration for interactive and conversational user experience.
- Machine learning model trained on labeled news datasets for binary classification (real/fake).
- Personalization logic and trust scoring to enhance reliability and minimize false positives.
- Real-time prediction and intuitive user feedback for decision-making support.

Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML/CSS
- Backend: Python, Flask
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, NLTK
- Chatbot: Python-based scripted chatbot
- Deployment Tools: Flask development server
